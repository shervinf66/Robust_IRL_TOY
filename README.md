# Monte Carlo Hidden Markov Model

This library is designed to create, train and use a Monte Carlo Hidden Markov Model.

## Master branch
The master branch contains the original Monte Carlo Hidden Markov Model proposed by Thrun et. al. in http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dgovinda/pdf/recog/thrun.hmm.pdf

## Layered Monte Carlo Hidden Markov Model Branch
This branch will implement a new structure for the model based on the Layered Hiddem Markov Model by Oliver et. at. in Layered representations for learning and inferring office activity from multiple sensory channels
